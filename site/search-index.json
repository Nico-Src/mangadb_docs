All protected routes are secured using a centralized authentication middleware that validates access tokens and enforces permission-based authorization.\nAuthentication &amp; Authorization Middleware\nThe API uses a middleware layer to protect routes and control access based on authentication state and permissions. For protected endpoints, an access token is extracted from the incoming request and validated using JWT verification. If the token is valid, the decoded user context is attached to the request and made available to downstream handlers.\nSome routes require only a valid authenticated session, while others additionally enforce specific permissions. In those cases, the middleware verifies that the authenticated user possesses all required permissions before allowing the request to proceed.

Overview\nThis section describes the main technologies used across the system and how they relate to each component.\n\nFrontend\nThe frontend is built using Nuxt and runs on Cloudflare

service\n\n\n\n\nBackend Services\nAll backend services are implemented as Node.js applications.\n\nRuntime: Node.js 16.5.0\nServices include:\n\nBackend API (api.manga-db.org)\nCDN service (cdn.manga-db.org)\nIO service (io.manga-db.org)\n\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nHandle business logic and request orchestration\nServe and manage media assets\nPerform file and I/O-related operations\n\n\nDatabase\nThe system uses MariaDB as its relational database.\n\nDatabase Engine: MariaDB 10.4\nUsage:\n\nStores application data and metadata\nAccessed primarily by the backend API\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Relationships\n\nThe Nuxt frontend communicates with backend Node.js services via HTTPS.\nNode.js services interact with the MariaDB database for persistent storage.\nMedia and file operations are handled through dedicated backend services to keep concerns separated.\n\n\nThis separation of technologies and responsibilities helps keep the system modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n"},"8":{"title":"Useful Commands","id":"system/useful-commands/","text":"Useful Commands\nThis document provides an overview of commonly used operational commands, including what each

Local\nrsync -avz --progress --delete \\\nroot@SERVER_IP:/root/mangadb_api/media/ \\\n&quot;LOCAL_PATH&quot;\n\nThis command synchronizes the contents of a specified directory on the server to LOCAL_PATH.\nThe --delete option removes files in LOCAL_PATH that do not exist in the source directory.\nMariaDB / MySQL\nThese commands provide basic management and maintenance operations for a MariaDB/MySQL database.\nStart Docker Container\ndocker start mariadb104\n\nThis command starts the MariaDB Docker container if it is not already running.\nLog into the MySQL Interface\ndocker exec -it mariadb104 mysql -u root -p\n\nImport SQL-File\ndocker exec -i mariadb104 mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u mangadb --password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD mangadb &lt; mangadb.sql\n\nImports an SQL file into a specified database.\n-h specifies the database host (must be 127.0.0.1).\n-u specifies the database user used for the import (typically mangadb).\n--password provides the password for the specified user.\nThe
